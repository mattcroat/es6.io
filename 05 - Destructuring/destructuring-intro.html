    // Destructuring is a JavaScript expression
    // that allows us to extract data from arrays, object, maps and sets
    // into their own variables
    const person = {
      first: 'Wes',
      last: 'Bos',
      country: 'Canada',
      city: 'Hamilton',
      twitter: '@wesbos'
    };

    // sometimes you need to have top level variables
    const first = person.first;
    const last = person.last;

    // instead of doing that we could do...
    // this is not a object or block, it's the destructuring syntax
    // this is saying give me a variable first and a variable last
    // and take it from person
    // outputing first would show "Wes" and last would show "Bos"
    const { first, last, twitter } = person;

    // let's look at some nested data
    // something we would get back from an api
    const wes = {
      first: 'Wes',
      last: 'Bos',
      links: {
        social: {
          twitter: 'https://twitter.com/wesbos',
          facebook: 'https://facebook.com/wesbos.developer',
        },
        web: {
          blog: 'https://wesbos.com'
        }
      }
    };

    // we could do something like...
    const twitter = wes.links.social.twitter;
    const facebook = wes.links.social.facebook;

    // but we could just use destructuring
    const { twitter, facebook } = wes.links.social;

    // another use case which would be renaming variables
    // when there are conflicting variable names
    const { twitter: tweet, facebook: fb } = wes.links.social;

    // ability to set defaults
    // let's say we have a function that will do some animation
    // on our page and it's going to create a element and style it for us
    // but...the thing that we're building also require a height, fontSize
    // how do we deal with them when they're not in there?
    // before you would have a defaults settings object
    // and then you would merge it with the settings one
    // but with es6 it's different by using destructuring
    // and setting a default value
    const settings = { width: 300, color: 'black' }
    const { width = 100, height = 100, color = 'blue', fontSize = 25 } = settings;
