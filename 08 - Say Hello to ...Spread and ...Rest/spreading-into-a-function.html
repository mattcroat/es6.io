    // (1) We want to join the two arrays but we get a nested array
    // with only push so we we can do push.apply with inventors passed in as this
    // and this works because when you call apply it's gonnna run the function
    // that you called apply against but as every single item of the array as an argument
    inventors.push.apply(inventors, newInventors);
    console.log(inventors);
    // but you can just ...spread it into a function
    inventors.push(...newInventors);

    // (2) Let's take this example
    const name = ['Wes', 'Bos'];

    function sayHi(first, last) {
      alert(`Hey there ${first} ${last}`);
    }
    // you could do this
    // but it doesn't work that well if it gets more complex
    sayHi(name[0], name[1]);
    // so instead we could just ...spread the array
    sayHi(...name)
