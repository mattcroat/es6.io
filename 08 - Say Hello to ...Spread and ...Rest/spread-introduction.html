    // and apply it to the containing array

    // (1) How to combine the two arrays?
    // We can do something like this
    const pizzas = featured.concat(specialty);
    // this would work
    console.log(pizzas);
    // (2) What if we wanted to insert a value in the middle?

    // is take every single item in the array and ...spread it to a new array
