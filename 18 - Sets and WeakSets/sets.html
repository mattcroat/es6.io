    // A Set in JavaScript is like a unique array
    // meaning that you can only add the same item once
    // with a nice API for managing the items inside of it
    // You can't access the items individually and it's not index based
    // Because it's index based length doesn't work but size does

    // Create a new Set by storing it in a variable
    const people = new Set();
    // Add items to a Set
    people.add('Wes');
    people.add('Snickers');
    people.add('Kait');
    // Remove items from a Set
    people.delete('Wes');
    // Clear entire Set
    people.clear();

    // SetIterator
    const it = people.values();
    // means it's a generator so we can loop over it
    it.next();

    // Feed it to a for...of loop
    for (const person of people) {
      console.log(people);
    }

    // Set also has methods of keys and entries
    people.keys(); // same as values
    people.entries(); // so the API is same as Map

    // Create values inside new Set
    const students = new Set(['Wes', 'Kara', 'Tony']);

    // We can pass an existing array to our Set
    const dogs = ['Snickers', 'Sunny'];
    const dogSet = new Set(dogs);

    // Use has to see if someone is in a Set
    students.has('Tony');
